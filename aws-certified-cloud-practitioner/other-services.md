## Cloud Migratioin Strategies - The 7Rs
Source: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/enterprise-strategy/new-possibilities-seven-strategies-to-accelerate-your-application-migration-to-aws/

![alt text](./images/image-510.png)

### Introduction to Cloud Migration Strategies
* Cloud migration strategies **help** organisations **move** their **applications** and **data** to the **cloud efficiently**.
* `Key Feature`: The seven Rs of cloud migration provide different approaches based on business needs and goals.

<br>

### The Seven Rs of Cloud Migration
`Retire`:
* Turn off services you no longer need.
* **Benefits**: Reduces attack surface, saves costs, and focuses on essential resources.

`Retain`:
* Keep resources on-premises.
* **Reasons**: Security, data compliance, performance, unresolved dependencies, or lack of business value in migrating.

`Relocate`:
* Move applications or EC2 instances to the cloud or different AWS regions/accounts.
  * **Example**: Using VMware Cloud on AWS to maintain the same setup as on-premises.

`Rehost "lift and shift"` (Lift and Shift):
* Migrate applications, databases, and data to AWS without changes.
* **Benefits**: Simple migration, potential cost savings, no cloud optimization required.

`Replatform "lift and reshape"` (Lift and Reshape):
* Migrate to AWS with some cloud optimizations.
  * **Example**: Moving databases to RDS or applications to Elastic Beanstalk for managed services benefits.

`Repurchase "drop and shop"` (Drop and Shop):
* Move to a different product or SaaS platform.
  * **Example**: Switching CRM to Salesforce, HR to Workday, or CMS to Drupal.

`Refactor / Re-architect`:
* Re-imagine and re-architect applications using cloud-native features.
* **Benefits**: Improved scalability, performance, security, and agility. Transition from monolithic to microservices architecture.

<br>

### Key Points to Remember
* `Cheapest Strategy`: Retire services you don't need.
* `Most Effort and Payoff`: Refactor and re-architect for maximum cloud benefits.
* `Incremental Approach`: Strategies like rehost and replatform offer a balance between effort and benefits.
