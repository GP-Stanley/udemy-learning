# What is Cloud Computing?

## Traditional IT Overview

### Introduction to Cloud Computing
`Cloud Computing`
* Using the **internet** to **access and store data** and **applications** instead of relying on your computer's hard drive.
* Makes it easier to access resources, scale up or down, and save costs.

### Basics of Website Functionality
* `Server`: A computer that **hosts websites** and **serves content** to users.
* `Client`: Your web browser or device that **requests content** from the server.
* `Network`: The **connection** that allows **data to travel between the server and your device**.
* `IP Address`: A **unique number** that **identifies each device on the network**, like an address for sending and receiving data.

### Analogy of Network Communication
* Letter Analogy: Think of sending data over the internet like sending a letter through the mail.
  * **Client**: You, the sender of the letter.
  * **Network**: The postal system that delivers the letter.
  * **Server**: The recipient of the letter.
  * **IP Address**: The address on the letter, ensuring it reaches the right place.

### Components of a Server
* üß†`CPU` (Central Processing Unit): The **brain** of the server, performing calculations and processing data.
* üóÉÔ∏è`RAM` (Random Access Memory): **Temporary storage** for quick data access, like short-term memory.
* üì¶`Storage`: **Permanent storage** for data, such as hard drives or SSDs.
* üìä`Database`: A structured way to **store data**, making it easy to search and retrieve.
* ü™¢`Networking Components`: Routers, switches, and DNS servers that manage data flow and connectivity.

### Traditional IT Setup
* `Home/Garage Servers`: Early websites and companies started with servers in homes or garages.
* `Data Centers`: Dedicated facilities for housing multiple servers as the company grows.

Challenges:
* üíµ`Cost`: High expenses for rent, power, cooling, and maintenance.
* üìà`Scalability`: Limited ability to quickly add or replace servers.
* ‚ò†Ô∏è`Disaster Recovery`: Risks from natural disasters, power outages, and hardware failures.
* ‚öíÔ∏è`Maintenance`: Need for a dedicated team to monitor and manage infrastructure.

### Transition to Cloud Computing
* `On-Demand Resources`: Access to computing power, storage, and networking as needed.
* `Scalability`: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
* `Cost-Efficiency`: Pay only for the resources used, reducing overall expenses.
* `Disaster Recovery`: Built-in redundancy and backup solutions to ensure data availability.

## What is Cloud Computing?
* Cloud computing is the **on-demand delivery** of **computing power**, **storage**, **applications**, and other IT **resources**.
  * **On-Demand**: You get resources when you need them.
  * **Pay-As-You-Go**: You only pay for what you use, and stop paying when you stop using it.

### Flexibility and Scalability
`Resource Provisioning`
* You can get exactly the type and size of resources you need.
  * Need a big server? It's available.
  * Need a small server? That's available too.
  * Need 10 servers today and 2 tomorrow? No problem.
`Instant Access`
* Resources are available instantly, without waiting.

### User-Friendly Interface
* Cloud platforms provide interfaces to **easily access** servers, storage, databases, and applications.

**AWS Example**: Amazon Web Services (AWS) owns and maintains the hardware, while you use what you need via a web application.

### Transition from Traditional IT to Cloud
* `Traditional IT`: Involves **setting up servers in homes** or data centers, which is **costly** and **time-consuming**.
* `Cloud Computing`: Uses data centers **managed by cloud providers**, allowing you to **pay only for what you use**.

### Everyday Cloud Services
* **Email**: Services like Gmail are cloud-based, and you pay only for the storage you use.
* **Storage**: Services like Dropbox and Google Drive store your files in the cloud.
* **Streaming**: Services like Netflix use cloud computing to deliver video on-demand.

<br>

### Types of Clouds

#### Private Cloud
* Used by a **single organisation**, **not exposed** to the public. 
* Managed by someone else but offers more **control** and **security**.

#### Public Cloud
* Provided by companies like Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, and AWS. 
* **Resources** are **owned** and **operated** by **third-party providers** and **delivered over the internet**.

#### Hybrid Cloud
* **Combines** private and public clouds, allowing you to **keep some resources on-premises** and **extend others to the cloud**.

### Characteristics of Cloud Computing
* `On-Demand and Self-Service`: Users can provision resources without needing help from the provider.
* `Broad Network Access`: Resources are available over the network and can be accessed in various ways.
* `Multi-Tenancy and Resource Pooling`: Multiple customers share the same infrastructure while maintaining security and privacy.
* `Rapid Elasticity and Scalability`: Resources can be quickly scaled up or down based on demand.
* `Measured Service`: Usage is measured, and you pay only for what you use.

### Advantages of Cloud Computing
* `Cost Efficiency`: Trade capital expenses (buying hardware) for operational expenses (renting resources).
* `Economies of Scale`: Lower prices due to the large scale of cloud providers.
* `No Capacity Guessing`: Scale resources automatically based on actual usage.
* `Increased Speed and Agility`: Quickly create and operate resources without delays.
* `Reduced Maintenance Costs`: No need to spend money on running and maintaining data centers.
* `Global Reach`: Leverage global infrastructure to create applications accessible worldwide.

## Types of Cloud Computing

#### Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)
* Provides the **basic building blocks** for cloud IT, such as networking, computers, and data storage. 
  * Think of it like building with LEGOs, giving you flexibility to migrate from traditional IT to the cloud.

#### Platform as a Service (PaaS)
* Removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure, allowing you to **focus on deploying** and **managing** your applications.

#### Software as a Service (SaaS)
* A complete product run and **managed by the service provider**. 
* You just **use the software without worrying about the infrastructure**.

### Comparison of Cloud Models

#### On-Premises
* You **manage everything**, including applications, data, runtime, middleware, operating system, virtualization, servers, storage, and networking.

#### IaaS
* You **manage applications**, data, runtime, middleware, and the operating system. 
* The **provider** (e.g., AWS) **manages virtualisation**, servers, storage, and networking.

#### PaaS
* You only **manage applications** and **data**. 
* The **provider** manages **everything else**, including runtime and networking.

#### SaaS
* The **provider manages everything**. You just use the software.

### Examples of Cloud Services
* `IaaS`: Amazon EC2, Google Cloud, Azure, Rackspace, Digital Ocean, Linode.
* `PaaS`: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Heroku, Google App Engine, Windows Azure.
* `SaaS`: AWS Rekognition, Google Apps (Gmail, Dropbox), Zoom.

### Cloud Pricing Fundamentals
* `Pay-As-You-Go`: You only pay for what you use.
* `Compute`: Pay for the exact compute time.
* `Storage`: Pay for the exact amount of data stored.
* `Networking`: Pay only when data leaves the cloud. Data entering the cloud is free.

### Advantages of Cloud Pricing
* `Cost Savings`: Only pay for what you need, reducing expenses compared to traditional IT.
* `Scalability`: Easily scale resources up or down based on demand.
* `Flexibility`: Access resources instantly without waiting.
