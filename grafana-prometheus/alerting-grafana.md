# Alerting in Grafana

## Key Concepts
### Alerting Components
* Alert Rule: Defines the conditions under which an alert is triggered.
* Contact Points: Specifies where alerts are sent (e.g., email, Slack).
* Notification Policies: Determines how alerts are routed to contact points.

#### Contact Points
* Contact points are the destinations where alerts are sent. 
* This can include email addresses, Slack channels, or other notification systems.

### Unified View
* The unified view provides a centralised interface for managing all alerts. It allows users to see all active alerts and their statuses in one place.
* A centralised view where all alerts set up by different team members can be observed.
* Alerts can also be viewed on the dashboard if the same query is used.

<br>

## Creating Alerts
### Creating a Rule
* An alert rule defines the specific conditions under which an alert is triggered.
* It includes the query, threshold, and evaluation interval.
* Alerts can be created from the unified view or directly from a dashboard panel.
  * Example: Creating an alert for CPU utilisation.

1. Navigate to the **unified view** or a specific **dashboard panel**.
2. Click on "Create Rule" and define the query and conditions for the alert.
3. Save the rule and monitor the alert status.

### Query for Alerts
* Use the same query for both alerts and dashboard views.
* Alternatively, write a separate query specifically for alerts.

### Alert Configuration
* Define the query and set the conditions for the alert.
* Example: Setting a threshold for memory utilisation.

1. Open the alert configuration panel.
2. Define the query, set the threshold, and specify the evaluation interval.
3. Save the configuration and test the alert.

### Evaluating Alerts
* Alerts are evaluated based on the defined conditions.
* Example: If a metric exceeds a threshold, the alert is triggered.

### Notification Policies
* Notification policies determine how alerts are routed to contact points. 
* They define the rules for sending alerts based on their severity and other criteria.

1. Go to the notification policies section.
2. Define the contact points (e.g., email, Slack) and routing rules.
3. Save the policies and ensure they are linked to the appropriate alerts.

<br>

## Alert Visualisation
### Data Representation
* Data can be viewed using different visualisation options like stats, table, and time series.
* Alerts are typically limited to time series-based visualisation.

### Creating Alerts from Panels
* Alerts can be created directly from a panel in the dashboard.
* Example: Setting an alert for the last value of a metric.

### Thresholds and Conditions
* Define thresholds for alerts (e.g., CPU usage above 80%).
* Alerts can be set to evaluate at specific intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).

<br>

## Advanced Alerting
### Multiple Queries:
* Alerts can be based on multiple queries.
* Example: Combining multiple metrics to trigger an alert.

### Polling Behavior:
* Alerts can be set to evaluate conditions at regular intervals.
* Example: Evaluating a threshold every 10 seconds.

### Notification Policies:
* Define how alerts are routed to contact points.
* Example: Sending an email notification when an alert is triggered.

<br>

## Practical Examples
### Applying Rules to Multiple Instances
* Use wildcards to apply alert rules to multiple instances.
* Example: Monitoring CPU usage across all instances in a VPC.

### Threshold Configuration
* Set specific thresholds for different metrics.
* Example: Setting a threshold for memory usage at 60%.

### Aggregated Functions
* Use functions like max, min, and last for alert conditions.
* Example: Using the last value of a metric to trigger an alert.

<br> 

## Benefits
`Proactive Monitoring`
* Alerts help in identifying issues before they become critical.
* Enables timely intervention and resolution.

`Centralised Management`
* Unified view allows for centralised management of all alerts.
* Simplifies monitoring and reduces the chances of missing critical alerts.

`Customisable Alerts`
* Alerts can be tailored to specific needs and conditions.
* Provides flexibility in monitoring different metrics and scenarios.

`Improved Collaboration`
* Teams can collaborate on setting up and managing alerts.
* Enhances communication and coordination among team members.

<br>

## Panel Configuration and Alerting in Grafana

## Panel Configuration
* Alert Window: The interface where alerts are created and managed.
* Alert Panel: A specific panel dedicated to displaying alerts.
* Time Series Visualisation: Alerts are typically restricted to time series visualisations.

## Triggering Alerts
* Alerts can be triggered based on specific conditions, such as a metric exceeding a threshold.
* Multiple conditions can be set for a single alert.

## Creating Alerts
### Creating an Alert
* Alerts can be created directly from the dashboard.
* Example: Triggering an alert when CPU utilisation exceeds 70%.

### Multiple Conditions
* Alerts can have multiple conditions.
* Example: Triggering an alert when CPU utilisation goes above 70% and another alert when it drops below 70%.

### Classic Condition
* Use classic conditions to apply multiple rules to a single alert.
* Example: Setting a range for CPU utilisation (e.g., between 70% and 90%).

## Configuring Alerts
### Thresholds and Conditions
* Define thresholds for alerts (e.g., CPU usage above 80%).
* Alerts can be set to evaluate at specific intervals (e.g., every 10 seconds).

### Notification Messages
* Custom messages can be included in notifications.
* Example: Adding a note to an email notification.

### Aggregation Functions
* Use functions like average, max, and min for alert conditions.
* Example: Setting an alert based on the average CPU utilisation.

## Practical Examples
### Setting Up Multiple Thresholds
* Example: Triggering an alert when CPU utilisation is above 90% and another when it is below 70%.
* Use classic conditions to set up these thresholds.

### Evaluating Alerts
* Alerts are evaluated based on the defined conditions.
* Example: If a metric exceeds a threshold, the alert is triggered.

### Using Classic Conditions
* Classic conditions allow for more complex alert configurations.
* Example: Setting an alert for a range of values (e.g., CPU utilisation between 70% and 90%).

## Instructions
### Creating an Alert
1. Navigate to the alert window or a specific dashboard panel.
2. Click on "Create Alert" and define the query and conditions for the alert.
3. Save the alert and monitor the alert status.

<br>

# Contanct Points

## Key Concepts
### Thresholds and Firing State
* Thresholds: Define the conditions under which an alert is triggered.
* Firing State: Indicates that an alert condition has been met, but additional steps like sample collection are required before the alert is fully activated.

### Contact Points
* Definition: Methods used to route alerts (e.g., email, PagerDuty, Slack).
* Configuration: Contact points can be configured to send notifications via different channels.

### Notification Policies
* Purpose: Connect alerts to contact points and define how notifications are sent.
* Configuration: Policies can include multiple matchers to route alerts to different teams or channels.

## Creating Alerts
### Creating a Contact Point
Steps:

1. Navigate to the alerting section.
2. Choose a contact point type (e.g., email).
3. Configure the contact point with necessary details (e.g., email addresses).
4. Save the contact point.

### Configuring Notification Settings
Options:
* Send a single email to all recipients or individual emails to each recipient.
* Include optional messages or templates in notifications.
* Disable notifications for resolved alerts to reduce email overload.

### Integrating with External Systems
* Options: Integrate with systems like Prometheus Alert Manager, WebEx Teams, Discord, Google Hangouts, Kafka, Microsoft Teams, OpsGenie, PagerDuty, and others.
* Webhooks: Use webhook URLs for integration with systems that support webhooks.
